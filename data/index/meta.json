It can\nbe considered a variant of CVE-2020-24588 but for mesh networks.\n\nThis patch tries to detect if a standard MSDU was turned into an A-MSDU\nby an adversary. This is done by parsing a received A-MSDU as a standard\nMSDU, calculating the length of the Mesh Control header, and seeing if\nthe 6 bytes after this header equal the start of an rfc1042 header. If\nequal, this is a strong indication of an ongoing attack attempt.\n\nThis defense was tested with mac80211_hwsim against a mesh network that\nuses an empty Mesh Address Extension field, i.e., when four addresses\nare used, and when using a 12-byte Mesh Address Extension field, i.e.,\nwhen six addresses are used.

However, the state might\nhave been freed by the time of this lookup.\n\nCurrently, if the state is not found, only a counter is incremented.\nThe secpath (sp) extension on the skb is not removed, resulting in\nsp->len becoming 0.\n\nSubsequently, functions like __xfrm_policy_check() attempt to access\nfields such as xfrm_input_state(skb)->xso.type (which dereferences\nsp->xvec[sp->len - 1]) without first validating sp->len. This leads to\na crash when dereferencing an invalid state pointer.\n\nThis patch prevents the crash by explicitly removing the secpath\nextension from the skb if the xfrm state is not found after hardware\ndecryption. This ensures downstream functions do not operate on a\nzero-length secpath.\n\n BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff000002c8\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n PGD 282e067 P4D 282e067 PUD 0\n Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP\n CPU: 12 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/12 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc7_for_upstream_min_debug_2025_05_27_22_44 #1 NONE\n Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n RIP: 0010:__xfrm_policy_check+0x61a/0xa30\n Code: b6 77 7f 83 e6 02 74 14 4d 8b af d8 00 00 00 41 0f b6 45 05 c1 e0 03 48 98 49 01 c5 41 8b 45 00 83 e8 01 48 98 49 8b 44 c5 10 <0f> b6 80 c8 02 00 00 83 e0 0c 3c 04 0f 84 0c 02 00 00 31 ff 80 fa\n RSP: 0018:ffff88885fb04918 EFLAGS: 00010297\n RAX: ffffffff00000000 RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 0000000000000000\n RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000000000000002 RDI: 0000000000000000\n RBP: ffffffff8311af80 R08: 0000000000000020 R09: 00000000c2eda353\n R10: ffff88812be2bbc8 R11: 000000001faab533 R12: ffff88885fb049c8\n R13: ffff88812be2bbc8 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff88811896ae00\n FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8888dca82000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n CR2: ffffffff000002c8 CR3: 0000000243050002 CR4: 0000000000372eb0\n DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n Call Trace:\n  <IRQ>\n  ? try_to_wake_up+0x108/0x4c0\n  ? udp4_lib_lookup2+0xbe/0x150\n  ? udp_lib_lport_inuse+0x100/0x100\n  ? __udp4_lib_lookup+0x2b0/0x410\n  __xfrm_policy_check2.constprop.0+0x11e/0x130\n  udp_queue_rcv_one_skb+0x1d/0x530\n  udp_unicast_rcv_skb+0x76/0x90\n  __udp4_lib_rcv+0xa64/0xe90\n  ip_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x20/0x130\n  ip_local_deliver_finish+0x75/0xa0\n  ip_local_deliver+0xc1/0xd0\n  ? ip_protocol_deliver_rcu+0x130/0x130\n  ip_sublist_rcv+0x1f9/0x240\n  ? ip_rcv_finish_core+0x430/0x430\n  ip_list_rcv+0xfc/0x130\n  __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x181/0x1e0\n  netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x200/0x360\n  ? mlx5e_build_rx_skb+0x1bc/0xda0 [mlx5_core]\n  gro_receive_skb+0xfd/0x210\n  mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq+0x141/0x280 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5e_poll_rx_cq+0xcc/0x8e0 [mlx5_core]\n  ? mlx5e_handle_rx_dim+0x91/0xd0 [mlx5_core]\n  mlx5e_napi_poll+0x114/0xab0 [mlx5_core]\n  __napi_poll+0x25/0x170\n  net_rx_action+0x32d/0x3a0\n  ? mlx5_eq_comp_int+0x8d/0x280 [mlx5_core]\n  ? notifier_call_chain+0x33/0xa0\n  handle_softirqs+0xda/0x250\n  irq_exit_rcu+0x6d/0xc0\n  common_interrupt+0x81/0xa0\n  </IRQ>"}, {"id": "CVE-2025-38591", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Reject narrower access to pointer ctx fields\n\nThe following BPF program, simplified from a syzkaller repro, causes a\nkernel warning:\n\n    r0 = *(u8 *)(r1 + 169);\n    exit;\n\nWith pointer field sk being at offset 168 in __sk_buff.

When a scan is initiated\non such P2P vifs, driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan\nfrequency, creates a scan vdev, and attaches arvif to the radio. Once the\nscan completes or is aborted, the scan vdev is deleted, detaching arvif\nfrom the radio and leaving arvif->ar uninitialized.\n\nWhile handling beacon miss for station interfaces, P2P interface is also\nencountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()\ntries to dereference the uninitialized arvif->deflink->ar.\n\nFix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing\nits ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.\n\n==========================================================================\n wlp6s0: detected beacon loss from AP (missed 7 beacons) - probing\n KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000010-0x0000000000000017]\n\n CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/5 Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1-wt-ath+ #2 PREEMPT(full)\n RIP: 0010:ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter+0xb5/0x1a0 [ath12k]\n Call Trace:\n  __iterate_interfaces+0x11a/0x410 [mac80211]\n  ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces_atomic+0x61/0x140 [mac80211]\n  ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss+0xa1/0xf0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_roam_event+0x393/0x560 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_wmi_op_rx+0x1486/0x28c0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_htc_process_trailer.isra.0+0x2fb/0x620 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_htc_rx_completion_handler+0x448/0x830 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_ce_recv_process_cb+0x549/0x9e0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_ce_per_engine_service+0xbe/0xf0 [ath12k]\n  ath12k_pci_ce_workqueue+0x69/0x120 [ath12k]\n  process_one_work+0xe3a/0x1430\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.1.c5-00284.1-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3"}, {"id": "CVE-2025-38607", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: handle jset (if a & b ...) as a jump in CFG computation\n\nBPF_JSET is a conditional jump and currently verifier.c:can_jump()\ndoes not know about that.
