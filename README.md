# Agent-ZeroV1
AgentZero – AI-Powered Local Vulnerability Scanner

AgentZero is my first attempt at building a local AI-powered vulnerability scanner. The goal is to provide a lightweight, adaptable tool that anyone can use, improve, or extend to strengthen their own security setups.

I’ll be continuously updating this project with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. Contributions are welcome — whether you’d like to add new functionality, enhance the AI logic, or optimize existing code.

🌟 Key Goals

Continuously track the latest CVE updates

Detect vulnerabilities that may not yet appear in commercial scanners

Provide a customizable foundation for local AI-based security agents

Help both organizations and small businesses stay on top of emerging threats

📌 Current Status

This is an early (pre-release) version of AgentZero. While it’s functional, it will continue to evolve as:

More features are implemented

Vulnerability tracking is expanded

Plugins and integrations are refined

🔮 Future Plans

Regular updates with new features

Improved scanning capabilities across:

Website servers

File servers

Operating systems

Other infrastructure components

More automation for keeping up with recently published vulnerabilities

⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a work in progress and not a finished product. It may require you to manually update or reference the NVD CVE database for the latest vulnerability data.
